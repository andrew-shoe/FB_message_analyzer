## Getting Started
- You will need to download your Facebook messages history. You can do this by going to Settings â†’ Your Facebook Information â†’ Download Your Information. Deselect everything other than Messages and create the file. Make sure to specify the file type as **JSON**. This may take up to a few hours to prepare depending on how big the file is.

## Setting up python environment
I recommend you install miniconda.
https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

Once you've installed miniconda, navigate to the wherever you cloned this repo and run the following three commands
```
$ conda create --name fb --file requirements.txt

$ source activate fb

$ jupyter notebook facebook.ipynb
```

This should open up the jupyter noteboot. All you need to do now is just run each cell from top to bottom. There will be a cell to fill out your name and some other options.
