## Getting Started
- You will need to download your Facebook messages history. You can do this by going to Settings â†’ Your Facebook Information â†’ Download Your Information. Deselect everything other than Messages and create the file. Make sure to specify the file type as **JSON**. This may take up to a few hours to prepare depending on how big the file is.

## Setting up python environment
I recommend you install miniconda.
